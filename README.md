# Elixir Solana SDK

_This package is provided AS-IS - It's not a priority to improve it right now - so don't expect any updates. I welcome PRs if you'd like to contribute!_

Solana SDK for Elixir - this is a fork of the original [solana](https://github.com/dcrck/solana-elixir) package with several additional features and improvements.

## Installation

I don't have any plans to publish this package to Hex, so you'll need to add it to your project manually. 

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_solana, github: "mikehostetler/ex_solana"}
  ]
end
```

## Prereqs

Install the [solana cli](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation)
