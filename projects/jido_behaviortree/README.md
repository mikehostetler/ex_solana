# Jido Behavior Tree

> **🧪 EXPERIMENTAL**
>
> This library is experimental and under active development.
> - Public APIs may change without notice, including breaking changes
> - Documentation and features are still evolving
> - Not recommended for critical production systems yet

An Elixir behavior tree implementation designed for Jido agents with integrated action support and AI compatibility.

## Overview

Behavior trees are a powerful control structure for AI systems, allowing complex decision-making logic to be composed from simple, reusable components. This library provides a comprehensive behavior tree system that integrates seamlessly with the Jido ecosystem.

## Features

- 🌳 **Complete Behavior Tree Engine** - Full implementation with composite, decorator, and leaf nodes
- 🔄 **Stateful Execution** - GenServer-based agents with manual and automatic execution modes  
- 🧠 **Blackboard Pattern** - Shared state management between nodes with get/put/update operations
- 🎯 **Jido Action Integration** - Execute Jido actions directly within behavior tree nodes
- 🤖 **AI Tool Compatible** - Convert behavior trees to OpenAI-compatible tool definitions
- 📊 **Telemetry Support** - Built-in instrumentation for monitoring and debugging
- ⚡ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript-style typing with TypedStruct and @spec annotations

## Status

✅ **Core Foundation Complete**
- Full behavior tree execution engine
- Comprehensive test coverage (88+ tests passing)
- Agent-based stateful execution
- AI skill wrapper integration

🚧 **In Development**
- Composite nodes (Sequence, Selector, Parallel)
- Decorator nodes (Inverter, Repeat, Timeout)
- Action leaf nodes with Jido Action integration

## Quick Start

### Basic Tree Creation

```elixir
# Define a simple test node
defmodule TestNode do
  use TypedStruct
  
  typedstruct do
    field(:data, term())
  end

  @behaviour Jido.BehaviorTree.Node

  def tick(node_state, _tick), do: {:success, node_state}
  def halt(node_state), do: node_state
end

# Create and execute a tree
node = %TestNode{data: "test"}
tree = Jido.BehaviorTree.new(node)
tick = Jido.BehaviorTree.tick()

{status, updated_tree} = Jido.BehaviorTree.tick(tree, tick)
# => {:success, %Jido.BehaviorTree.Tree{...}}
```

### Agent-based Execution

```elixir
# Start an agent for stateful execution
{:ok, agent} = Jido.BehaviorTree.start_agent(
  tree: tree,
  blackboard: %{user_id: 123},
  mode: :manual
)

# Execute ticks
status = Jido.BehaviorTree.Agent.tick(agent)

# Access blackboard
Jido.BehaviorTree.Agent.put(agent, :result, "success")
value = Jido.BehaviorTree.Agent.get(agent, :result)

# Switch to auto mode for continuous execution
Jido.BehaviorTree.Agent.set_mode(agent, :auto)
```

### AI Integration

```elixir
# Create a skill from a behavior tree
skill = Jido.BehaviorTree.skill(
  "process_data",
  tree,
  "Processes data using behavior tree logic",
  schema: [
    input_data: [type: :map, required: true],
    user_id: [type: :integer, required: true]
  ]
)

# Convert to AI tool format
tool_def = Jido.BehaviorTree.Skill.to_tool(skill)
# => %{
#   "name" => "process_data",
#   "description" => "Processes data using behavior tree logic",
#   "parameters" => %{...}
# }

# Execute the skill
{:ok, result} = Jido.BehaviorTree.Skill.run(skill, %{
  input_data: %{name: "John"},
  user_id: 123
}, %{})
```

## Core Concepts

### Status Types

Every node returns one of these statuses:

- `:success` - Node completed successfully
- `:failure` - Node failed to complete  
- `:running` - Node is still executing
- `{:error, reason}` - Node encountered an error

### Node Types

- **Composite Nodes**: Control execution of child nodes (Sequence, Selector, Parallel)
- **Decorator Nodes**: Modify behavior of a single child (Inverter, Repeat, Timeout)  
- **Leaf Nodes**: Perform actual work (Action, Wait, SetBlackboard)

### Blackboard

Shared data structure enabling communication between nodes:

```elixir
# Get/put values
blackboard = Jido.BehaviorTree.blackboard(%{user_id: 123})
updated = Jido.BehaviorTree.Blackboard.put(blackboard, :status, "active")
value = Jido.BehaviorTree.Blackboard.get(updated, :user_id)

# Update with functions
updated = Jido.BehaviorTree.Blackboard.update(blackboard, :counter, 0, &(&1 + 1))
```

## Installation

Add to your `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:jido_behaviortree, "~> 1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
mix test

# Run quality checks  
mix quality

# Generate docs
mix docs
```

## Telemetry

The library emits telemetry events for monitoring:

- `[:jido_behaviortree, :node, :tick, :start]` - Node tick started
- `[:jido_behaviortree, :node, :tick, :stop]` - Node tick completed  
- `[:jido_behaviortree, :agent, :tick, :start]` - Agent tick started
- `[:jido_behaviortree, :agent, :tick, :stop]` - Agent tick completed

## Integration with Jido

This package integrates with the broader Jido ecosystem:

- **jido_action** - Execute Jido actions within behavior tree nodes
- **jido** - Main agent framework for autonomous systems
- **jido_signal** - Signal processing and event handling

## Roadmap

- [ ] Complete composite node implementations
- [ ] Full decorator node suite
- [ ] Rich action leaf nodes with Jido Action integration
- [ ] Visual tree editor and debugger
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Enhanced telemetry and monitoring
