defmodule Jido.AI.TRM.Supervision do
  @moduledoc """
  Deep Supervision Module for TRM (Tiny-Recursive-Model) strategy.

  This module provides structured prompt construction and feedback parsing for the
  supervision and improvement phases of the TRM recursive improvement cycle. It handles:

  - Building supervision prompts for critical answer evaluation
  - Parsing LLM feedback to extract issues, suggestions, and quality scores
  - Building improvement prompts that incorporate feedback
  - Supporting iterative refinement with previous feedback context

  ## Overview

  The TRM supervision phase takes a question and current answer, then generates
  critical evaluation that identifies:
  - Issues with accuracy, completeness, clarity, and relevance
  - Specific suggestions for improvement
  - An overall quality score (0.0-1.0)

  The improvement phase then applies this feedback to generate an improved answer.

  ## Usage

      # Build supervision prompt
      context = %{
        question: "What is machine learning?",
        answer: "ML is a type of AI",
        step: 1,
        previous_feedback: nil
      }

      {system, user} = Supervision.build_supervision_prompt(context)

      # Parse supervision response
      feedback = Supervision.parse_supervision_result(llm_response)
      # %{issues: [...], suggestions: [...], quality_score: 0.65}

      # Build improvement prompt
      {system, user} = Supervision.build_improvement_prompt(
        context.question,
        context.answer,
        feedback
      )
  """
